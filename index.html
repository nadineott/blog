    <div class = post>Have you ever seen this video?</div><br>

    </div><br>
    <div class = post>This pretty much describes MakerSquare. The excitement of having all these great concepts and problems and lectures thrown at you, and then the inevitable panic when they don&rsquo;t stop coming and you just got the tiniest handle on the first one. When the dog runs under the table? That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at right now. Excited because I know this is a really good thing that&rsquo;s happening, terrified because there&rsquo;s so much of it, and gearing up to run back out into the storm of tennis balls because at the end of the day, this is the best thing to ever happen to me.<br><br>


    On an entirely unrelated note, I&rsquo;ve encountered the most eloquent public speaker I&rsquo;ve ever seen. He does not use any filler words. Ever. There are meaningful silences while he ponders a question, pauses while he gathers himself or types code, but never an &quotuh&quot, &quotlike&quot, or &quotyou know&quot. His firm grasp on the subject makes him a great teacher, and his precise method of speaking makes him a fantastic communicator. The combination makes me want to secretly videotape a lecture of his to model my own presentation skills after. I won&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s illegal in 7 ways, but you get the point.</div><br>

    <div class = postTitle>MakerSquare: night before Week 2 Day 1</div>
    <div class = post>
          What a week. I&rsquo;ll hit the main points since it&rsquo;s all a blur at this point. 
          <ul>
            <li>Not surprisingly, my feeling of impending doom about my next pair partner was completely unfounded. Not only completely unfounded, but completely inaccurate. I couldn&rsquo;t have been happier with my pair. She was smart and communicative and had a great attitude and a quirky sense of humor. She helped me when I fell behind and was vocal when she needed a hand as well. <br><br>
            <li>My mom learned how to text and preceeded to send me encouraging texts throughout the week. I would be concentrating hard on a problem, my eyes aching and my body tense, trying to pin down why in the world my function wasn't working after 90 minutes of tweaking...and all of a sudden the messenger app on my computer would open and I&rsquo;d get a delightful little snippet of support and love from my mom. Doesn't get much better than that <br><br>
            <li>I had an insanely productive Sunday. More productive than most full weekends, likely because one 1 day weekends pack so much more value per day than 2 day weekends. Having said that...I am going to miss having Saturdays free. I&rsquo;m going to miss that very much. <br><br>
            <li>It has officially been four and a half hours since Varun texted &quotbe home soon&quot and I have yet to see him walk through the door. Normally this would irk me a little bit, but not today. I have a finite amount of brain space available at the moment, and getting annoyed at his propensity towards tardiness isn&rsquo; t a good use of it. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be thrilled when he catches onto this.

    <div class = post>   
           First self assessment was today and man was I nervous. It went as expected- it was chaotic and I felt rushed and panicked and nervous and terrified the whole time. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. Not because it went well, it didn&rsquo;t, but because I survived and now I know I can survive whatever else comes my way. Bring it. <br><br>

           Something that struck me today was how I hadn&rsquo;t had any coffee at all, was functioning on 4 hours of sleep, and didn&rsquo;t feel tired. Let me elucidate on this. I am not a person who has ever been able to function well on little sleep, in fact in my experience I function quite poorly on anything less than 7 hours. I usually throw back coffee to no avail and find myself daydreaming of a pristine bed magically appearing for me to collapse into, while my eyelids grow heavy and I am unable to focus on the task at hand. Weirdly enough this hasn&rsquo;t been the case since I stated MakerSquare. I think it&rsquo;s because I am constantly stimulated and interested in the task at hand. Give my brain something to focus on besides the exhaustion hanging heavy like a thick fog and the fog ceases to exist! Even weirder than this new phenomenon is that instead of being pumped about it, I&rsquo;m a bit saddened by how it took me this long to discover it. Oh the perspective I&rsquo;m gaining after only three days, I wonder what I&rsquo;ll learn tomorrow. <br><br></div>

    <div class = post>
           Day one was great, we were reviewed stuff we had already done in the precourse work and spent a lot of time getting to know each other. I left completely reassured that MakerSquare was the best choice for me, starting my career from scratch at 26 was a good idea, and everything would be okay. Tomorrow is our first assessment, and I&rsquo;m terrified. What if I do poorly on the first assessment? Will I be marked with a scarlet &quotD&quot for dummie? Will I be put on some sort of probation? Will it be indicative that I just am not smart enough for this? It reminds me of the Shell Silverstein poem Whatif, which perfectly describes my train of thought every night as I settle into sleep and pray it will be an quick transition to blissful slumber. It rarely is. My brain is in an infinite Whatif loop and there&rsquo;s no alt+ctrl+del option. <br><br>

                                  Last night, while I lay thinking here, <br>
                                  Some Whatifs crawled inside my ear<br>
                                  And pranced and partied all night long<br>
                                  And sang their same old Whatif song:<br>
                                  Whatif I&rsquo;m dumb in school?<br>
                                  Whatif they&rsquo;ve closed the swimming pool? <br>
                                  Whatif I get beat up?<br>
                                  Whatif there&rsquo;s poison in my cup?<br>
                                  Whatif I start to cry?<br>
                                  Whatif I get sick and die?<br>
                                  Whatif I flunk that test?<br>
                                  Whatif green hair grows on my chest?<br>
                                  Whatif nobody likes me?<br>
                                  Whatif a bolt of lightning strikes me?<br>
                                  Whatif I don&rsquo;t grow talle?<br>
                                  Whatif my head starts getting smaller?<br>
                                  Whatif the fish won&rsquo;t bite?<br>
                                  Whatif the wind tears up my kite?<br>
                                  Whatif they start a war?<br>
                                  Whatif my parents get divorced?<br>
                                  Whatif the bus is late?<br>
                                  Whatif my teeth don&rsquo;t grow in straight?<br>
                                  Whatif I tear my pants?<br>
                                  Whatif I never learn to dance?<br>
                                  Everything seems swell, and then<br>

          Tomorrow is the start of our second sprint and I&rsquo;ll be switching from my beloved (read: familiar) pair partner that joins me in this class from our prep class. I&rsquo;m incredibly apprehensive about my next partner. What if they are lightyears ahead of me? What if they are condescending and can barely conceal their disgust at my lack of knowledge? Oh the possibilities.<br><br> </div>

    <div class = postTitle>How it started</div>
          <div class = post>Not long ago I found myself talking to my superior at work regarding a problem that, given an engineering fix, would have saved me about 30 minutes per day. Let me be clear- this was 30 minutes of entirely pointless transferring data from point A to point B. I was on a team of ten people, and assuming we all got hit with this issue equally, that would be about 5 hours per day, 25 hours per week, 100 hours per month. 100 hours a month to be used for far better puroses after this engineering fix, which apparently was a &quotweek long fix&quot on the part of an engineer. I&rsquo;ll equate that to 50 hours of work. <br><br>

          Bear with me here while I do some simple math. My team spent 100 hours per month doing this. It would have taken an engineer 50 hours to eliminate this process for my team completely. How great is that? Two weeks after implementing this fix the company would have broken even on employee time used vs. employee time gained. What I didn&rsquo;t understand was that my math was wrong. An hour of my time was not worth an hour of an engineer&rsquo;s time. Not even close. <br><br>

          When I proposed we move forward at full speed with the fix, I was told that it was &quotnot worth it.&quot Mind. Blown. 100 hours of my teams time per month on an ongoing basis is &quotnot worth&quot 50 hours of an engineer&rsquo;s time. <br><br>

          Have you ever been picked last for kickball? Or dumped out of nowhere by someone who you thought was pretty swell? It felt kind of like that. I wanted to jump up and down and scream &quotI&rsquo;m a worthwhile person! I work my butt off and I&rsquo;m pretty smart to boot! Why is my time worth nothing compared to that person&rsquo;s time?&quot Instead, I went with the smile, nod, and the ever fitting &quotThanks for taking the time to look into it.&quot <br><br>

          I thought about figuring out a way to bring this issue to my superiors in a new light, add more value to the proposition, you know the drill. But this hadn&rsquo;t been the first time I had been stonewalled with the ever powerful &quotengineering effort&quot argument. I had a feeling it wouldn&rsquo;t be the last. That night when I got home I Googled &quotlearn to code.&quot <br><br>

    And that&rsquo;s how it started.<br><br><br><br></div>
